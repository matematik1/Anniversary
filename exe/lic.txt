A poem for you (full version)

We are happy to welcome our dear mother
On the day of the anniversary, which finally came.
For us, mom, you are the best mother,
Your maternal love warms us.
And you and I are always inseparable,
Mother will hold all of us close to her heart,
And may you be well,
For all of us, you are like the bright sun!
And may your health be strong,
And the days will be filled with sincere joy,
Tirelessly let the heart beat in the chest,
For the comfort, for the joy of the whole family.
May God send you abundance,
Let the light shine always and forever,
The fire is in the furnace and do not go out,
You are a mother, be! You live for all of us!
